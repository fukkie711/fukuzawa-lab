## Laboratory Features

In this lab, we value the cycle of **"Build, Measure, and Think."** We tackle problems through the twin pillars of theory and implementation, striving to design systems that function effectively in the real world.

- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Research that combines perspectives from management, information science, and human behavior.
- **Emphasis on Implementation:** We prioritize shaping ideas into working, functional systems.
- **Trial and Error Welcome:** The process of failure is also recorded and shared as a vital part of the research.

## To Prospective Students

In our laboratory, through graduation research and seminars, you will cultivate the "ability to formulate your own questions and find your own solutions." We value **curiosity, perseverance, and integrity** more than prior programming experience.
